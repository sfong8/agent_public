UBS, BNP Paribas, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, Barclays and Deutsche Bank in recent weeks reported a combined \u20ac13bn in revenues from equities and fixed income trading between January and March, the highest combined quarterly total for the five lenders since at least 2015. The performance by European banks mirrors the stellar trading returns posted by US peers during the first three months of the year, with Wall Street\u2019s five largest banks reaping almost $37bn in combined trading revenues during the period. Since returning to the White House in January, Trump has ushered in a period of economic uncertainty, triggering wild swings in stock, bond and currency markets that have created opportunities for traders to exploit. \u201cMarket volatility is broadly supportive of global market businesses for banks, as is the case for us,\u201d SocGen chief executive Slawomir Krupa told analysts. \u201cThe disruption is manageable for everybody from a macro perspective.\u201d The first quarter of 2025 produced a record performance at the markets divisions of UBS and BNP Paribas. The Swiss lender\u2019s trading revenues jumped by nearly a third to $2.5bn (\u20ac2.3bn) compared with the same period a year earlier, while France\u2019s largest bank posted an all-time high of \u20ac2.8bn in trading revenues during the quarter. Deutsche Bank \u2014 which no longer has an equities trading business \u2014 and Barclays reported a surge of 17 per cent and 21 per cent respectively in fixed income, currencies and commodities (FICC) trading compared to the first quarter in 2024, outperforming all Wall Street lenders in percentage gains in FICC during the period. SocGen\u2019s trading performance was driven by its equities business, where revenues rose by more than a fifth on the previous year to \u20ac1.06bn, while its fixed income division saw a slight decline. After producing meagre returns and shareholder payouts for much of the last decade, European lenders have seen a turnaround in their fortunes in recent years, with higher interest rates boosting their net interest income \u2014 the difference between the interest banks receive from borrowers and pay out to depositors. However, banks\u2019 trading divisions have also benefited from bouts of market volatility, starting with the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020. This was followed by significant market swings in early 2022 after Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine and central banks rapidly increased interest rates. Before the most recent quarter, the first three months of 2022 held the crown as the quarter with the highest trading revenues for European banks since at least 2015, with the five banks producing \u20ac12.8bn in combined revenues during that period. Credit Suisse was also a significant player in equities and FICC trading in Europe before its demise in 2023. Sergio Ermotti, UBS\u2019s chief executive, said last week that the Swiss lender had seen \u201ca huge spike in client activity and volatility\u201d at the start of the second quarter after Trump announced a raft of \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs on April 2, triggering a market sell-off. \u201cOn some days, trading volumes exceeded their Covid-era peak by around 30 per cent,\u201d he said, describing the activity levels as \u201cquite exceptional\u201d. Andrew Coombes, an analyst at Citigroup, said: \u201cThis bodes well for [second quarter] markets revenues, following on from strong equities and FICC results in [the first quarter].\u201d \u201c[Ermotti] did, however, confirm that there is now a degree of investor fatigue and it\u2019s since returned to a more normalised trading environment,\u201d Coombes added.

It is fair to assume that, had any of the last few chief executives of Barclays bank been asked to sign a letter urging the government to rescind punitive regulations, they\u2019d have jumped at the chance. From John Varley, who ran Barclays during the 2008 financial crisis, to Jes Staley, CEO up to three-and-a-bit years ago, the bank\u2019s bosses have consistently campaigned to resist government bailouts and fend off onerous regulations. Not Venkat, as he is universally known. CS Venkatakrishnan, Barclays\u2019 boss since late 2021, last week went public in support of so-called ringfencing, one of the onerous post-2008 rules forcing big complex banks to structurally protect their core UK deposit-taking operations inside separate legal entities with higher levels of capital. Arguing that he was \u201c on the side of depositor protection \u201d, Venkat recalled that it was not long since banks had to be bailed out by the state. Ringfencing should not be scrapped or watered down, he said. A few days earlier the Barclays boss had declined to sign a letter to UK chancellor Rachel Reeves from other top bank CEOs, taking the polar opposite line. That letter , orchestrated by HSBC boss Georges Elhedery, had urged Reeves to prove \u201cthe government\u2019s determination to do what it takes to promote growth\u201d and pledge at her July Mansion House speech that ringfencing would be abolished during the current parliament.\u00a0 Cue dissent across the City of London (including within Barclays itself), plus a mystery as to why the bank that has probably lost the most from ringfencing\u2019s restrictions, thanks to its large investment banking and US credit card operations, would want to maintain such curbs. Like HSBC, Barclays is said by bank insiders to have spent at least \u00a31bn implementing ringfencing. The rules impose ongoing costs, such as duplicate operations and governance overheads, and create inefficiencies by restricting how funds can be deployed within the broader group. So why has Barclays gone out on a limb, apparently against its own self-interest? Venkat\u2019s public reasoning \u2014 a desire to protect depositors \u2014 sounds noble but strikes an odd note: surely a bank CEO should be confident he can be a trusted guardian of customer money, without the need for a state diktat. Perhaps his prior career at Barclays \u2014 first as chief risk officer, then as head of markets \u2014 has made him distrustful that his investment bankers won\u2019t misuse retail deposits. A hard rule is a helpful strut. Pragmatism also plays a part. In addition to the sunk cost of implementation, Venkat has built a whole strategy for Barclays that aligns with the ringfenced structure, doubling down on UK retail banking and curtailing growth in its global investment banking operations. Taking a pro-regulation line may also curry further favour with policymakers who generally dislike being publicly lobbied. (Venkat broke with much of the business world last autumn when he praised Reeves\u2019 widely criticised tax-raising Budget.) The calculus for the chancellor is a tricky one. Ringfencing probably has held back Britain\u2019s banks, particularly internationally, but it is fanciful to think the rule is to blame for their failure to keep pace with Wall Street rivals: a weaker domestic economy, the trauma of 2008 (particularly at NatWest/RBS and Barclays) and tougher regulations in other areas have been far more impactful. Advocates of reform also posit that ringfencing is now superfluous: since it was introduced, other safety mechanisms \u2014 requirements for capital, liquidity and orderly wind-down in a crisis \u2014 have been significantly toughened: you don\u2019t need a belt and braces if your waistband is already tight. Recommended Lex Barclays PLC Barclays\u2019 UK rebalancing act looks wobbly Premium \u00a0content Few other countries have adopted a similar construct. Switzerland is one, though its 2023 decision to force the failing Credit Suisse into a rescue by UBS, rather than save the ringfenced domestic operation and wind down the rest of the group, did nothing to prove the effectiveness of such a mechanism. As with any deregulatory measure, Reeves will have to offset growth benefits against the downsides of losing a safety mechanism \u2014 particularly for consumers aka voters. Aside from boosting the security of deposits (beyond the sector-wide \u00a385,000 guarantee), bankers believe ringfencing has kept mortgage rates artificially low. Once UK funding is no longer trapped, rates could rise. \u201cRemoving ringfencing would be foolish policy and odd politics,\u201d says Sir John Vickers, the Oxford academic who led the regulatory commission that conceived the rules. Even if Reeves concludes that the Elhedery camp is right, and Venkat is wrong, it would take a long time \u2014 and new primary legislation \u2014 to revoke ringfencing. A quick spur for growth it certainly isn\u2019t. patrick.jenkins@ft.com Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2025 . All rights reserved.

UBS, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale and Barclays have become the latest banks to reap a windfall from the market turmoil unleashed by US President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs, as traders helped power the lenders to better than expected first-quarter profits. Revenues at UBS\u2019s markets business surged 32 per cent to a record $2.5bn, SocGen\u2019s trading revenues climbed 11 per cent to \u20ac1.76bn, while Barclays reported a 16 per cent increase to \u00a32.7bn. Since returning to the White House in January, Trump\u2019s erratic tariff policy has dominated global stock, bond and currency markets, triggering volatility as investors contend with the fallout from his attempt to remake the global trading order. UBS said on Wednesday: \u201cMarkets are likely to remain sensitive to new developments, both positive and negative, which are likely to lead to further spikes in volatility.\u201d The stellar trading performance helped the three banks\u2019 profits surpass expectations for the quarter, cushioning the blow from a slowdown in dealmaking in the period. UBS reported net profit of $1.7bn in the quarter, surpassing the $1.3bn forecast by analysts, but down from $1.8bn in the same period a year ago. Revenues were flat at $12.6bn. SocGen\u2019s net income more than doubled to \u20ac1.6bn while profits at Barclays rose to \u00a31.9bn, up from \u00a31.6bn a year ago, exceeding forecasts. The trio join Wall Street\u2019s biggest banks in riding the market volatility. JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Bank of America and Citigroup together generated almost $37bn in trading revenues in the quarter. At Soc Gen, the equities trading business stood out, with revenues climbing more than a fifth to a record \u20ac1.06bn. Barclays\u2019 fixed-income traders delivered a 21 per cent jump in revenues while revenues in equities rose 9 per cent. The strong showing from UBS\u2019s trading business overshadowed its global wealth management business, the bank\u2019s biggest profit engine in recent years. The division attracted $32bn in new assets in the period, with the unit\u2019s pre-tax profit of $1.4bn driven by higher fees. Todd Tuckner, UBS\u2019s chief financial officer, said there was a rise in client activity at the bank in response to Trump\u2019s tariff announcement in early April, but added that there was \u201cmore and more uncertainty getting priced in\u201d. \u201cApril started out OK-ish, but if this environment persists, then naturally it\u2019ll have an impact on our activity levels with our clients.\u201d \u201cPersistent uncertainty will create more sellers and buyers,\u201d Tuckner said. \u201cAnd if it does persist, we\u2019ll move people to the sidelines versus being active.\u201d Separately, and even without a sizeable trading business, Santander still managed to post a record profit in the first quarter, with net income jumping 19 per cent to \u20ac3.4bn, the company announced on Wednesday. The Spanish lender was helped by a strong performance at its retail business, especially in Spain, where it benefited from a decision to spread out the burden of the country\u2019s banking tax across the full year rather than booking it all during the first quarter. It also reported record net fee income during the period, in part thanks to higher trading activity at its global markets division. Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2025 . All rights reserved.
