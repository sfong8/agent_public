Photograph: IrKiev/Getty Images/iStockphoto Barclays Barclays to bar trans women from using its female bathrooms Boss confirms policy change as businesses move to comply with recent supreme court ruling Joanna Partridge Wed 30 Apr 2025 13.56 BST First published on Wed 30 Apr 2025 13.45 BST Share The boss of Barclays has said the bank will prohibit trans women from using female bathrooms in its buildings in the wake of the recent supreme court ruling . The bank\u2019s chief executive, CS Venkatakrishnan, told reporters that the group would not allow trans women to use female bathrooms, to ensure that it complies with the law. The UK supreme court ruled earlier in April that the terms \u201cwoman\u201d and \u201csex\u201d in the Equality Act referred only to a biological woman and to biological sex. Venkatakrishnan said on a media call: \u201cFollowing the supreme court ruling \u2026 we believe that we have to comply with that by not allowing trans women to use female bathrooms. \u201cWe strive in every way to make the appropriate facilities available in a comfortable way for people to use and to provide equality of opportunities and development.\u201d View image in fullscreen CS Venkatakrishnan. Photograph: Brendan McDermid/Reuters After the court ruling, the UK\u2019s equalities watchdog issued interim guidance that trans women \u201cshould not be permitted to use the women\u2019s facilities\u201d in workplaces or public-facing services such as shops and hospitals, with the same applicable to trans men using men\u2019s toilets. However, the Equality and Human Rights Commission also insisted that trans men and women should not be left without access to facilities. The watchdog is working on a more detailed code of practice that it aims to hand to the government by June for ministerial approval. Barclays is one of the first companies to announce a change to its bathroom policy after the court decision, as organisations review their approach to comply with the ruling. Britain\u2019s first transgender judge, Victoria McCloud, has said she will take the UK to the European court of human rights over the supreme court ruling. She intends to bring action for infringement of her article 6 rights, which guarantee the right to a fair trial in both criminal and civil matters in the European convention on human rights (ECHR). The move by Barclays comes weeks after the lender scrapped its gender and ethnicity targets for US staff, joining the ranks of UK companies that have bowed to Donald Trump\u2019s anti-diversity drive. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Venkatakrishnan made the decision after a review of its approach to diversity, equity and inclusion, which started in late 2024. On Wednesday, the bank\u2019s boss insisted it was committed to equality and equal opportunities. \u201cThere should be an inclusive working environment where everybody should be comfortable and have the best form of personal expression,\u201d Venkatakrishnan said. Barclays reported a 19% rise in pre-tax profits to \u00a32.72bn for the three months to the end of March, as it set aside more cash for bad debts in the face of \u201cheightened uncertainty\u201d about the US economy and a global trade war.

Read our privacy notice . The boss of banking giant Barclays has confirmed the banking giant will ban trans women from using female toilets following the Supreme Court ruling earlier this month. Group chief executive CS Venkatakrishnan, known within the bank as Venkat, said the group would not allow trans women to use female lavatories to ensure it complies with the law. It follows recent guidance by the equalities watchdog in the wake of the Supreme Court ruling that the term \u201cwoman\u201d is defined by biological sex. The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) said earlier this month that trans women \u201cshould not be permitted to use the women\u2019s facilities\u201d in workplaces or public-facing services, such as shops and hospitals. The same applies to trans men, who are biologically female, using men\u2019s toilets. But the watchdog also insisted that trans people should not be put in a position where there are no facilities for them to use. Venkat told reporters on a media call after posting quarterly results: \u201cFollowing the Supreme Court ruling\u2026 we believe that we have to comply with that by not allowing trans women to use female bathrooms. \u201cWe strive in every way to make the appropriate facilities available in a comfortable way for people to use and to provide equality of opportunities and development,\u201d he added. Barclays also ditched the diversity targets at its US business earlier this month after American President Donald Trump issued executive orders cutting federal programmes aimed at supporting women, ethnic minorities, LGBTQ+ people and other traditionally under-represented groups. But Venkat insisted the bank was \u201ccommitted\u201d to its principles on equality and equal opportunities. He said: \u201cThere should be an inclusive working environment where everybody should be comfortable and have the best form of personal expression.\u201d Venkat added: \u201cThe Wall Street that I joined was not as diverse as it is today. \u201cI\u2019ve been given opportunities throughout my career\u2026 I\u2019m a great personal believer in this.\u201d Companies, as well as schools, sports clubs and public services across the UK are among those reviewing their policies following the supreme court ruling.

CNBC's \\\"Squawk Box Europe\\\" on Wednesday, Barclays CEO C.S. Venkatakrishnan said he was expecting \\\"fairly high market volatility\\\" as a result of U.S. trade policy going forward. He added that the lender was prepared for a range of scenarios, including economic slowdowns in the U.K. or U.S. watch now VIDEO 4:48 04:48 We are deeply committed to the UK, Barclays Group CEO says Squawk Box Europe British bank Barclays on Wednesday reported slight beats on the top and bottom line in the first quarter, boosted by stronger investment bank performance. Pre-tax profit came in at \u00a32.7 billion ($3.6 billion), up 11% year-on-year and ahead of analyst expectations of \u00a32.49 billion, according to LSEG. Group revenues hit \u00a37.7 billion, above an analyst projection of \u00a37.33 billion. Income from investment banking, its most profitable division, increased 16% to \u00a33.87 billion. Barclays' return on tangible equity, a measure of profitability, reached 14 % in the first quarter, after averaging 7.5% in the December quarter. Shares were 2% higher in early deals in London, but ended the day down 0.4%. Key to investors is how Barclays navigates its sizable U.S. exposure in the market storm unleashed by U.S. President Donald Trump's global trade tariffs. Notably, Barclays has had a significant presence Stateside since acquiring the investment banking and capital markets businesses of collapsed Wall Street titan Lehman Brothers for $1.75 billion. Speaking to CNBC's \\\"Squawk Box Europe\\\" on Wednesday, Barclays CEO C.S. Venkatakrishnan said he was expecting \\\"fairly high market volatility\\\" going forward. \\\"It's calmer now but I imagine it will continue to go up and down. Beyond that, as you've seen in our results, that market volatility helps us help clients manage their risk, we can do so in a profitable way that helps them as well and helps markets income, as long as you manage your risk well,\\\" he said, pointing to strong fixed income trading as a highlight from the earnings. Venkatakrishnan continued, \\\"I think, going forward, the longer this goes on, the greater economic uncertainty there is, which is putting companies off from making decisions. Individuals also take time to make decisions, you could have a risk of a slowdown in economic activity.\\\" \\\"Even though we have a good starting point, we have to be prepared\\\" for a range of scenarios, he told CNBC, including economic weakness in its major markets of the U.K. and the U.S. The British lender's U.S. consumer bank business has made strides, delivering a 9.1% return on tangible equity in 2024, from 4.1% in 2023. Income at the unit nudged 1% higher to \u00a3864 million in the first quarter, though profit before tax slid 7% to \u00a355 million. Stock Chart Icon Stock chart icon Barclays share price. In a Wednesday note, analysts at RBC Capital Markets said the pre-tax profit beat was driven by income but partially offset by higher than expected impairments. The bank's exposure to the U.S. consumer and investment banking is likely to weigh on the stock more than on other U.K. banks until the \\\"rhetoric around global trade wars subsides,\\\" they added. Barclays shares took a steep tumble as the\\u00a0White House kicked off its trade war on April 2, but recovered thereafter and remain up more than 10% in the year to date \u2014 in sharp contrast to Swiss giant UBS , whose U.S. foothold and domestic concerns have led to a hemorrhage in stock value. Barclays' core U.K. consumer bank unit meanwhile posted 12% higher income of \u00a3484 million and 23% higher pre-tax profit of \u00a3207 million, supported by its acquisition of Tesco Bank. Britain could receive a rare economic boon as a result of its divorce from the European Union, after the bloc was struck with 20% in \u2014 now briefly suspended \u2014 U.S. reciprocal tariffs in early April. London, which only faces 10% in such White House levies, is now attempting to leverage its historic transatlantic relationship and a broadly more balanced trade record with the U.S. to secure a sweeter commercial arrangement. However, a wider slowdown in global trade and growth is expected to weigh on the economy . Barclays' pressures at homes have eased, with behemoth HSBC announcing plans to wind down its M&A\\u00a0and equity capital markets businesses in the U.K., U.S. and Europe amid a revamp of its investment operations. And the British unit of Spanish lender Banco Santander \u2014 which dethroned UBS to become continental Europe's largest bank by market capitalization in recent weeks \u2014 in March said that 750 of its staff were at risk of redundancy, as it targets 95 branch closures as part of a broader plan to update its footprint from June 2025. While Santander insists that the U.K. remains a \\\"core market,\\\" the latest move has added to questions whether the Spanish lender intends to exit the British high street.

It is fair to assume that, had any of the last few chief executives of Barclays bank been asked to sign a letter urging the government to rescind punitive regulations, they\u2019d have jumped at the chance. From John Varley, who ran Barclays during the 2008 financial crisis, to Jes Staley, CEO up to three-and-a-bit years ago, the bank\u2019s bosses have consistently campaigned to resist government bailouts and fend off onerous regulations. Not Venkat, as he is universally known. CS Venkatakrishnan, Barclays\u2019 boss since late 2021, last week went public in support of so-called ringfencing, one of the onerous post-2008 rules forcing big complex banks to structurally protect their core UK deposit-taking operations inside separate legal entities with higher levels of capital. Arguing that he was \u201c on the side of depositor protection \u201d, Venkat recalled that it was not long since banks had to be bailed out by the state. Ringfencing should not be scrapped or watered down, he said. A few days earlier the Barclays boss had declined to sign a letter to UK chancellor Rachel Reeves from other top bank CEOs, taking the polar opposite line. That letter , orchestrated by HSBC boss Georges Elhedery, had urged Reeves to prove \u201cthe government\u2019s determination to do what it takes to promote growth\u201d and pledge at her July Mansion House speech that ringfencing would be abolished during the current parliament.\\u00a0 Cue dissent across the City of London (including within Barclays itself), plus a mystery as to why the bank that has probably lost the most from ringfencing\u2019s restrictions, thanks to its large investment banking and US credit card operations, would want to maintain such curbs. Like HSBC, Barclays is said by bank insiders to have spent at least \u00a31bn implementing ringfencing. The rules impose ongoing costs, such as duplicate operations and governance overheads, and create inefficiencies by restricting how funds can be deployed within the broader group. So why has Barclays gone out on a limb, apparently against its own self-interest? Venkat\u2019s public reasoning \u2014 a desire to protect depositors \u2014 sounds noble but strikes an odd note: surely a bank CEO should be confident he can be a trusted guardian of customer money, without the need for a state diktat. Perhaps his prior career at Barclays \u2014 first as chief risk officer, then as head of markets \u2014 has made him distrustful that his investment bankers won\u2019t misuse retail deposits. A hard rule is a helpful strut. Pragmatism also plays a part. In addition to the sunk cost of implementation, Venkat has built a whole strategy for Barclays that aligns with the ringfenced structure, doubling down on UK retail banking and curtailing growth in its global investment banking operations. Taking a pro-regulation line may also curry further favour with policymakers who generally dislike being publicly lobbied. (Venkat broke with much of the business world last autumn when he praised Reeves\u2019 widely criticised tax-raising Budget.) The calculus for the chancellor is a tricky one. Ringfencing probably has held back Britain\u2019s banks, particularly internationally, but it is fanciful to think the rule is to blame for their failure to keep pace with Wall Street rivals: a weaker domestic economy, the trauma of 2008 (particularly at NatWest/RBS and Barclays) and tougher regulations in other areas have been far more impactful. Advocates of reform also posit that ringfencing is now superfluous: since it was introduced, other safety mechanisms \u2014 requirements for capital, liquidity and orderly wind-down in a crisis \u2014 have been significantly toughened: you don\u2019t need a belt and braces if your waistband is already tight. Recommended Lex Barclays PLC Barclays\u2019 UK rebalancing act looks wobbly Premium \\u00a0content Few other countries have adopted a similar construct. Switzerland is one, though its 2023 decision to force the failing Credit Suisse into a rescue by UBS, rather than save the ringfenced domestic operation and wind down the rest of the group, did nothing to prove the effectiveness of such a mechanism. As with any deregulatory measure, Reeves will have to offset growth benefits against the downsides of losing a safety mechanism \u2014 particularly for consumers aka voters. Aside from boosting the security of deposits (beyond the sector-wide \u00a385,000 guarantee), bankers believe ringfencing has kept mortgage rates artificially low. Once UK funding is no longer trapped, rates could rise. \u201cRemoving ringfencing would be foolish policy and odd politics,\u201d says Sir John Vickers, the Oxford academic who led the regulatory commission that conceived the rules. Even if Reeves concludes that the Elhedery camp is right, and Venkat is wrong, it would take a long time \u2014 and new primary legislation \u2014 to revoke ringfencing. A quick spur for growth it certainly isn\u2019t. patrick.jenkins@ft.com Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2025 . All rights reserved.

(Peter Dazeley/Getty Images)\\nBarclays Bank looks set to ban trans women employees from using toilets that align with their gender, following the Supreme Court\u2019s recent ruling.\\nEarlier this month, the UK\u2019s top judges ruled that the protected characteristic of \u201csex\u201d, under the terms of the 2010 Equality Act, referred to \u201cbiological\u201d women and not transgender women.\\nDespite the ruling, trans people are still protected from discrimination under the legislation, and former jurist Dr Victoria McCloud , the UK\u2019s only out trans judge, has vowed to challenge the judgement.\\nIn light of the ruling, and provisional guidance from the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC), which has said it was now \u201ccompulsory\u201d for workplaces to provide single-sex toilets, Barclays has said it will review its internal policy.\\nAccording to The Telegraph , the bank\u2019s previous policy of allowing trans women to use toilets that align with their gender identity will be scrapped, leaving them to use disabled facilities or the men\u2019s.\\n\u2018We will make any changes necessary\u2019\\nAnne O\u2019 Donoghue, a former Barclays human resources director, said at a trans rights protest at the bank\u2019s Canary Wharf office in 2023: \u201cI spend far too much time talking about this and why it is important. From an LGBT+ perspective, what we want to do, and we do have it in our policy, is that you can use the facilities which align to your gender identity.\\n\u201cThat is in our policy, that is our approach, that is what we do.\u201d\\nHowever, a spokesperson for Barclays has now said: \u201cWe will make any changes to our practices that are necessary to ensure we are compliant with legal requirements and we are reviewing the Supreme Court\u2019s recent ruling. We will be making any necessary changes to comply with the EHRC interim guidance.\u201d\\nBarclays chief executive CS Venkatakrishnan has already been quoted as saying: \u201cFollowing the Supreme Court ruling\u2026 we believe we have to comply with that by not allowing trans women to use female bathrooms.\u201d\\nYou may like to watch\\nShare your thoughts!\\u00a0 Let us know in the comments below, and remember to keep the conversation respectful.\\nMore: Barclays bank supreme court Trans\\nNov 29 2023\\n56 celebrities you didn\u2019t know are gay, bisexual or lesbian\\nHow did this story make you feel?\\n\ud83d\udd25\\nFired up\\n\u2764\ufe0f\\nLove\\n\ud83d\ude0a\\nHappy\\n\ud83d\ude10\\nMeh\\n\ud83d\ude21\\nAnnoyed\\n\ud83d\ude22\\nSad\\nSending reaction...\\nThanks for your feedback!\\nPlease\\nlogin\\nor\\nregister\\nto comment on this story.\\nQueer News.
