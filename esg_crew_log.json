Help change the world by becoming a Bureau Insider\\nSupport TBIJ\\nPublished May 13 2024\\nBy\\nJosephine Moulds\\n ,\\nNimra Shahid\\nTBIJ co-publishes its stories with major media outlets around the world so they reach as many people as possible.\\nFind out how to use our work\\nBarclays has been branded \u201ctotally dishonest\u201d by one of its investors for calling tens of billions of dollars for fossil fuel companies \u201csustainable finance\u201d.\\nThe UK high street bank says it is helping to address climate change by raising $1 trillion in sustainable and transition finance by 2030. This includes sustainability-linked loans and bonds, in which a company agrees to meet certain climate-related targets or else face a higher interest rate.\\nBut these targets can be weak and the penalties for failing to meet them paltry. The company can also use the money raised how it sees fit, meaning supposedly sustainable finance could fund polluting activities.\\nAndrew Harper of Epworth, an investment manager owned by the Methodist church that invests in Barclays, said: \u201cWe\u2019re concerned because the bank is making such a substantial claim and the public thinks the climate emergency is being worked towards being solved. Meanwhile, the problem is getting worse and worse. We think it\u2019s totally dishonest.\\n\u201cIf they are calling the financing of any fossil fuel companies sustainable finance, that to me is greenwash.\u201d\\nBarclays said: \u201cWe are committed to being transparent and report separately on the green finance, sustainable finance and the sustainability-linked finance mobilised towards our $1 trillion target, so stakeholders and investors have a clear understanding of what we are reporting.\u201d It said it set out very clear requirements for energy clients\u2019 targets and transition plans in order to access finance.\\n\u2018Deeply problematic\u2019 deals\\nBarclays helped raise $41bn in sustainability-linked finance for fossil fuel companies last year, according to an analysis by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism of data from LSEG, the financial markets group. The $41bn figure covers the total value of the deals Barclays worked on alongside other banks. Barclays itself counts only the funding it is directly responsible for, which it said was $10.9bn across all sectors last year.\\nKatharina Lindmeier, responsible investments manager at the publicly owned workplace pension\\n scheme Nest, which also invests in Barclays, said TBIJ\u2019s findings were \\n\u201cvery concerning\u201d. She added: \u201cWe\u2019ll be raising this research with their\\n management team directly at the next opportunity.\\n\u201cRegulators are looking closely at the issue of \\ngreenwashing and if there is any uncertainty, it\u2019s better to be cautious\\n than to mislead customers. Any loans which help companies expand oil \\nand gas infrastructure should not be classed as sustainable.\u201d\\nBarclays hits back at greenwashing revelations\\nThe Financial Conduct Authority, the UK regulator, wrote to\\n banks last year highlighting concerns about this type of loan, \\nincluding weak incentives, potential conflicts of interest, and low \\nambition. It said that these may lead to accusations of greenwashing.\\n Anders Schelde, chief investment officer of \\nAkademikerPension, another Barclays investor, said sustainability-linked\\n finance for oil and gas companies is \u201cin most cases deeply \\nproblematic\u201d. He said: \u201cWe don\u2019t count sustainability-linked bonds and \\nloans as green investments in our own accounting because we know there \\nare so many problems with them. The penalties are low and the targets \\noften insufficient.\u201d\\nLast year, Barclays helped raise $3bn worth of \\nsustainability-linked loans and bonds for Enbridge, a company that is \\ndramatically expanding oil and gas infrastructure across North America.\\nEnbridge is behind the construction of a controversial \\n1,000-mile pipeline that cuts through Indigenous land in the US to pump \\ntar sands oil. It paid US police to crack down on protesters and has \\nbeen fined millions of dollars for repeated environmental violations.\\n\u2018We do not need greener pipelines, we need to stop the reckless expansion of the fossil fuel industry\u2019\\nBarclays classifies the Enbridge debt as sustainable \\nbecause the company has set a target to cut emissions from its own \\noperations. In part, it intends to do this by using solar power to pump \\noil through its pipelines.\\n\u201cThe real source of emissions from a company like Enbridge \\nwill be from the oil and gas its pipelines help transport,\u201d said Jeanne \\nMartin from responsible investment charity ShareAction. \u201cWe do not need \\ngreener pipelines, we need to stop the reckless expansion of the fossil \\nfuel industry.\\n\u201cIf the conditions that a bank sets to provide financing to\\n oil and gas transport companies don\u2019t tackle oil and gas, the bank will\\n be accused of greenwashing.\u201d\\nBarclays also helped raise a $2.8bn sustainability-linked \\nloan for Harbour Energy, the UK\u2019s largest oil and gas producer. Harbour \\nextracted the equivalent of nearly 70m barrels of oil last year, which \\nif burned would produce the equivalent of eight coal-fired power \\nstations\u2019 annual emissions.\\nScientists agree that developing any new oil and gas fields\\n will derail climate targets and push global heating beyond 1.5 degrees \u2013\\n which the UN says will threaten lives, food sources and economies \\nworldwide.\\nIt seems that Harbour is aggressively exploring for new oil\\n and gas as it hopes to extract a further 880 million barrels of \\nreserves in the coming decades. It does not appear from Harbour\u2019s public\\n statements that the company has any plans to shift its focus to \\nrenewables.\\nYet Barclays\u2019 loan to Harbour Energy is called sustainable \\nbecause the company has committed to reducing emissions from the process\\n of extracting oil and gas. This, however, takes no account of \\nthe vast majority of Harbour\u2019s emissions, which are generated from \\nburning the oil and gas itself.\\nEnbridge paid US police to crack down on protesters opposing its Line 3 pipeline\\nNicole Neri/Bloomberg via Getty Images\\nThe notorious oil trader Trafigura also benefited from more\\n than $5.4bn in loans that Barclays called sustainable finance. Counting\\n its supply chain and all the emissions generated by the oil it trades \\nand transports, Trafigura was responsible for more greenhouse gas \\nemissions last year than Spain.\\nTrafigura\u2019s interest payments are linked to certain \\nsustainability targets, including a pledge to cut emissions \u2013 but only \\nfrom its own operations rather than the burning of the fuels it trades \\nand transports. This accounts for about 1% of the company\u2019s total \\nemissions.\\nTrafigura said Barclays was one of 54 banks involved in the\\n deal, and said \u201csustainability-linked loans are an important tool in \\nincentivising reductions in emissions\u201d. It added that its direct \\nemissions were less than 1% of Spain\u2019s. While it reports its indirect \\nemissions, it does not consider all of them \u201cto be within our current \\nsphere of influence\u201d.\\nEnbridge said it takes climate change seriously and is \\ncommitted to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions. It said \\nsustainability-linked finance plays an important role in meeting \\nemission-reduction goals and supporting the transition to a lower carbon\\n economy. The company also said that the 1,000-mile Line 3 pipeline had \\nlocal and tribal approvals and met the strictest environmental \\nstandards, and that payments to law enforcement were made and \\nadministered via a third party.\\nHarbour did not respond to a request for comment.\\nBarclays said: \u201cSustainability linked loans and bonds are \\nan important sustainable finance tool, incentivising borrowers, \\nparticularly in hard to abate sectors, to achieve sustainability \\nobjectives over time.\u201d\\nNet-zero banking\\nBarclays has committed to cut its emissions \u2013 including of \\nthe companies it finances \u2013 to net zero by 2050. To reach this target, \\nit will have to stop providing money to companies that refuse to shift \\naway from fossil fuels.\\nEnbridge's Line 3 project cuts through Indigenous land\\nTim Evans/Bloomberg via Getty Images\\nBut a report out today shows that the bank\u2019s funding for \\nfossil fuels increased in 2023 from 2022, which troubled shareholders \\nwho have been urging it to reduce lending in line with its climate \\ntargets. Barclays was Europe\u2019s top funder of the fossil fuel industry \\nlast year, according to the report led by the Rainforest Action \\nNetwork.\\nLindmeier, the Nest investment manager, said: \u201cWe want to \\nsee Barclays immediately reduce its financing to companies behind new \\nfossil fuel expansion. Any delays could leave the company more exposed \\nto bad loans and potentially cost them millions of pounds.\u201d\\nLaura Hillis from the Church of England pensions board, \\nanother Barclays investor, said: \u201cWe are looking for banks to produce a \\nclear climate plan and to see the commitments carry through into lending\\n decisions. Our concern is that these fossil fuel financing figures show\\n that is not happening at the pace we\u2019d like.\u201d\\nClimate-conscious investors have been putting pressure on \\nBarclays to make good on its net-zero pledge and earlier this year the \\nbank committed to stop providing specific project finance for oil and \\ngas expansion and related infrastructure.\\nHowever, less than 2% of Barclays\u2019 funding for oil and gas \\nlast year fell under the label of \u201cproject finance\u201d. Almost all of it \\ncomes in the form of general, unrestricted finance for the companies \\nundertaking those projects.\\n\u201cBarclays\u2019 new oil and gas policy is an important step \\nforward for the bank but it should have gone so much further,\u201d said \\nMartin from ShareAction, which brought together Barclays shareholders to\\n urge the bank to restrict lending to oil and gas companies.\\n\u201cUltimately, the bank has kept the right to finance \\ncompanies that have plans to massively expand the fossil fuel industry \\nwith no strings attached, and that\u2019s a real problem.\u201d\\nReporters: Josephine Moulds and Nimra Shahid Environment editor: Robert Soutar Impact producer: Grace Murray Deputy editor: Chrissie Giles Editor: Franz Wild Production: Alex Hess and Frankie Goodway Fact checker: Ero Partsakoulaki\\nThis reporting is funded by the Sunrise Project.

The company has pledged to cease direct financing of new oil and gas projects for energy clients, in alignment with its ambitious goal to finance $1 trillion of Sustainable and Transition Finance by 2030, according to ESG News . These strategic changes underscore Barclays\u2019 dedication to promoting environmentally responsible practices within the financial sector. The announcement details Barclays\u2019 updated Climate Change Statement, which introduces several key measures to enhance its support for the energy transition. Notably, the company will no longer provide project finance or direct funding to energy clients involved in upstream oil and gas expansion projects or related infrastructure. Additionally, new energy clients engaged in expansion will face restrictions, reflecting Barclays\u2019 commitment to prioritising investments in low-carbon initiatives. The British bank has also emphasised the importance of transition strategies and decarbonisation efforts for energy clients, setting clear expectations for methane reduction targets and net-zero aligned emissions targets. Furthermore, the company expects energy clients to develop comprehensive transition plans or decarbonisation strategies by January 2025, highlighting its proactive approach to driving sustainable practices across industries. The Transition Finance Framework , which has been recently outlined by Barclays, has revealed the criteria for transition finance transactions aimed at facilitating the necessary capital for the energy transition. This framework aligns with the company\u2019s goal of mobilising $1tn of Sustainable and Transition Finance by the end of 2030, reflecting its commitment to supporting real-world decarbonisation efforts. Laura Barlow, Group Head of Sustainability, said,\u00a0\u201cAddressing climate change is a critical and complex challenge. We continue to work with our energy clients as they decarbonise and support their efforts to transition in a manner that is just, orderly and addresses energy security. Today we strengthen our commitment to the energy transition, with policies that will focus our capital and resources to the energy companies that play a key role in the transition.\u201d Daniel Hanna, Head of Sustainable Finance, Corporate and Investment Bank, adds,\u00a0\u201cCapital is critical to the energy transition, to decarbonise hard-to-abate sectors for the world to reach net zero emissions and create a resilient economy. As the number two ranked clean energy advisor globally by BloombergNEF, Barclays is strongly positioned with our capabilities and experience, global reach and role in the global economy to accelerate the investment needed for real-world decarbonisation, while supporting our energy clients\u2019 transition. \u201cPublishing our Transition Finance Framework reinforces our commitment to be transparent in how we are mobilising $1trillion of Sustainable and Transition Finance by the end of 2030 while Barclays continues to be a leading global clean energy adviser and financier, unlocking growth from the energy transition.\u201d Keep up with all the latest FinTech news\u00a0 here .

Please let us know if you have feedback .\\nDive Brief:\\nBarclays\u2019 Group Head of Sustainability Laura Barlow is stepping down from her role, a spokesperson for the bank confirmed to ESG Dive Tuesday. Barlow will remain with the bank in the capacity of a senior adviser.\\nBarlow\u2019s responsibilities will be taken on by Daniel Hanna, who serves as Barclays\u2019 Group Head of Sustainable and Transition Finance, the bank spokesperson said. Hanna joined the bank in 2022 as a sustainable finance leader for its investment banking division.\\nBarlow\u2019s exit, first reported by Reuters Monday , comes as banks and financial institutions are facing heightened scrutiny over their sustainability efforts, particularly in the U.S. So far this year, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase exited the Net-Zero Banking Alliance while BlackRock departed the Net-Zero Asset Managers initiative \u2014 both United Nations-backed membership groups that support the goal of reaching net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 or sooner.\\nDive Insight:\\nBarlow retired from her sustainability leadership role at Barclays toward the end of 2024 to \u201cpursue a portfolio career\u201d and \u201cother opportunities,\u201d according to Reuters\u2019 report. She joined the bank in 2021, per her LinkedIn profile .\\nDuring Barlow\u2019s tenure, Barclay\u2019s committed to cease direct financing for new fossil fuel projects , including any new upstream oil and gas, thermal coal expansion projects or related infrastructure to help achieve its net-zero goals as part of a strategy update the bank shared last February. The bank also unveiled a Transition Finance Framework at the same time, which laid out how it will classify \u201ctransition finance\u201d and allocate funding to decarbonize high-emitting sectors. This framework aims to track the bank\u2019s progress against a prior commitment it made to allocate $1 trillion in sustainable and transition financing by 2030.\\nHowever, Barclays has also faced criticism on its climate-related commitments \u2014 or lack thereof \u2014 under Barlow\u2019s leadership.\\nDuring the bank\u2019s 2024 annual general meeting in May, a group of shareholders called on Barclays to pull back its financing for fracking operations in North America and \u201cclose the loopholes\u201d in its energy policy. The shareholders also called for the bank to impose \u201cexplicit restrictions\u201d on providing financial support for companies focused on fossil fuel extraction.\\nDespite the bank\u2019s prior announcement to cease funding of new fossil fuel projects, investors \u2014 organized under responsible investment nonprofit ShareAction \u2014 contended at the time that the bank \u201ccontinues to leave the door open to pour millions into polluting fossil fuel finance, and particularly worryingly, fracking.\u201d\\nBarlow\u2019s exit comes less than two months after rival bank HSBC announced its chief sustainability officer, Celine Herweijer, would step down at the end of last year. HSBC\u2019s move followed a corporate reshuffle that downsized the bank\u2019s executive committee, ultimately eliminating Herweijer\u2019s position .\\nIn the Nov. 24 statement announcing her exit , HSBC said Herweijer was departing her role to \u201cpursue new opportunities.\u201d At the time, the bank also said its Head of Global Banking for the Middle East, North Africa and Turkey, Julian Wentzel, would assume the role of interim chief sustainability officer this month and that it had begun recruiting for a \u201cpermanent successor\u201d for the CSO role.\\nRecommended Reading\\nBarclays ceases direct funding of new fossil fuel projects\\nBy\\nLamar Johnson\\n\u2022\\nFeb. 12, 2024\\nBarclays pressed on climate commitments and Gaza at annual meeting\\nBy\\nZoya Mirza\\n\u2022\\nMay 10, 2024\\npurchase licensing rights\\nFiled Under:\\nSustainability,\\nCorporate Governance,\\nFinance\\nESG Dive news delivered to your inbox\\nGet the free daily newsletter read by industry experts\\nEmail:\\nSelect user consent:\\nBy signing up to receive our newsletter, you agree to our\\n Terms of Use and\\n Privacy Policy .

Help change the world by becoming a Bureau Insider\\nSupport TBIJ\\nPublished May 13 2024\\nBy\\nJosephine Moulds\\n,\\nNimra Shahid\\nTBIJ co-publishes its stories with major media outlets around the world so they reach as many people as possible.\\nFind out how to use our work\\nBarclays has been branded \u201ctotally dishonest\u201d by one of its investors for calling tens of billions of dollars for fossil fuel companies \u201csustainable finance\u201d.\\nThe UK high street bank says it is helping to address climate change by raising $1 trillion in sustainable and transition finance by 2030. This includes sustainability-linked loans and bonds, in which a company agrees to meet certain climate-related targets or else face a higher interest rate.\\nBut these targets can be weak and the penalties for failing to meet them paltry. The company can also use the money raised how it sees fit, meaning supposedly sustainable finance could fund polluting activities.\\nAndrew Harper of Epworth, an investment manager owned by the Methodist church that invests in Barclays, said: \u201cWe\u2019re concerned because the bank is making such a substantial claim and the public thinks the climate emergency is being worked towards being solved. Meanwhile, the problem is getting worse and worse. We think it\u2019s totally dishonest.\\n\u201cIf they are calling the financing of any fossil fuel companies sustainable finance, that to me is greenwash.\u201d\\nBarclays said: \u201cWe are committed to being transparent and report separately on the green finance, sustainable finance and the sustainability-linked finance mobilised towards our $1 trillion target, so stakeholders and investors have a clear understanding of what we are reporting.\u201d It said it set out very clear requirements for energy clients\u2019 targets and transition plans in order to access finance.\\n\u2018Deeply problematic\u2019 deals\\nBarclays helped raise $41bn in sustainability-linked finance for fossil fuel companies last year, according to an analysis by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism of data from LSEG, the financial markets group. The $41bn figure covers the total value of the deals Barclays worked on alongside other banks. Barclays itself counts only the funding it is directly responsible for, which it said was $10.9bn across all sectors last year.\\nKatharina Lindmeier, responsible investments manager at the publicly owned workplace pension\\n scheme Nest, which also invests in Barclays, said TBIJ\u2019s findings were \\n\u201cvery concerning\u201d. She added: \u201cWe\u2019ll be raising this research with their\\n management team directly at the next opportunity.\\n\u201cRegulators are looking closely at the issue of \\ngreenwashing and if there is any uncertainty, it\u2019s better to be cautious\\n than to mislead customers.

The company has pledged to cease direct financing of new oil and gas projects for energy clients, in alignment with its ambitious goal to finance $1 trillion of Sustainable and Transition Finance by 2030, according to ESG News . These strategic changes underscore Barclays\u2019 dedication to promoting environmentally responsible practices within the financial sector. The announcement details Barclays\u2019 updated Climate Change Statement, which introduces several key measures to enhance its support for the energy transition. Notably, the company will no longer provide project finance or direct funding to energy clients involved in upstream oil and gas expansion projects or related infrastructure. Additionally, new energy clients engaged in expansion will face restrictions, reflecting Barclays\u2019 commitment to prioritising investments in low-carbon initiatives. The British bank has also emphasised the importance of transition strategies and decarbonisation efforts for energy clients, setting clear expectations for methane reduction targets and net-zero aligned emissions targets. Furthermore, the company expects energy clients to develop comprehensive transition plans or decarbonisation strategies by January 2025, highlighting its proactive approach to driving sustainable practices across industries. The Transition Finance Framework , which has been recently outlined by Barclays, has revealed the criteria for transition finance transactions aimed at facilitating the necessary capital for the energy transition. This framework aligns with the company\u2019s goal of mobilising $1tn of Sustainable and Transition Finance by the end of 2030, reflecting its commitment to supporting real-world decarbonisation efforts. Laura Barlow, Group Head of Sustainability, said,\\u00a0\u201cAddressing climate change is a critical and complex challenge. We continue to work with our energy clients as they decarbonise and support their efforts to transition in a manner that is just, orderly and addresses energy security. Today we strengthen our commitment to the energy transition, with policies that will focus our capital and resources to the energy companies that play a key role in the transition.\u201d Daniel Hanna, Head of Sustainable Finance, Corporate and Investment Bank, adds,\\u00a0\u201cCapital is critical to the energy transition, to decarbonise hard-to-abate sectors for the world to reach net zero emissions and create a resilient economy. As the number two ranked clean energy advisor globally by BloombergNEF, Barclays is strongly positioned with our capabilities and experience, global reach and role in the global economy to accelerate the investment needed for real-world decarbonisation, while supporting our energy clients\u2019 transition. \u201cPublishing our Transition Finance Framework reinforces our commitment to be transparent in how we are mobilising $1trillion of Sustainable and Transition Finance by the end of 2030 while Barclays continues to be a leading global clean energy adviser and financier, unlocking growth from the energy transition.\u201d Keep up with all the latest FinTech news\\u00a0 here .

This includes sustainability-linked loans and bonds, in which a company agrees to meet certain climate-related targets or else face a higher interest rate.\\nBut these targets can be weak and the penalties for failing to meet them paltry. The company can also use the money raised how it sees fit, meaning supposedly sustainable finance could fund polluting activities.\\nAndrew Harper of Epworth, an investment manager owned by the Methodist church that invests in Barclays, said: \u201cWe\u2019re concerned because the bank is making such a substantial claim and the public thinks the climate emergency is being worked towards being solved. Meanwhile, the problem is getting worse and worse. We think it\u2019s totally dishonest.\\n\u201cIf they are calling the financing of any fossil fuel companies sustainable finance, that to me is greenwash.\u201d\\nBarclays said: \u201cWe are committed to being transparent and report separately on the green finance, sustainable finance and the sustainability-linked finance mobilised towards our $1 trillion target, so stakeholders and investors have a clear understanding of what we are reporting.\u201d It said it set out very clear requirements for energy clients\u2019 targets and transition plans in order to access finance.\\n\u2018Deeply problematic\u2019 deals\\nBarclays helped raise $41bn in sustainability-linked finance for fossil fuel companies last year, according to an analysis by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism of data from LSEG, the financial markets group. The $41bn figure covers the total value of the deals Barclays worked on alongside other banks. Barclays itself counts only the funding it is directly responsible for, which it said was $10.9bn across all sectors last year.\\nKatharina Lindmeier, responsible investments manager at the publicly owned workplace pension\\n scheme Nest, which also invests in Barclays, said TBIJ\u2019s findings were \\n\u201cvery concerning\u201d. She added: \u201cWe\u2019ll be raising this research with their\\n management team directly at the next opportunity.\\n\u201cRegulators are looking closely at the issue of \\ngreenwashing and if there is any uncertainty, it\u2019s better to be cautious\\n than to mislead customers. Any loans which help companies expand oil \\nand gas infrastructure should not be classed as sustainable.\u201d\\nBarclays hits back at greenwashing revelations\\nThe Financial Conduct Authority, the UK regulator, wrote to\\n banks last year highlighting concerns about this type of loan, \\nincluding weak incentives, potential conflicts of interest, and low \\nambition. It said that these may lead to accusations of greenwashing.\\n Anders Schelde, chief investment officer of \\nAkademikerPension, another Barclays investor, said sustainability-linked\\n finance for oil and gas companies is \u201cin most cases deeply \\nproblematic\u201d. He said: \u201cWe don\u2019t count sustainability-linked bonds and \\nloans as green investments in our own accounting because we know there \\nare so many problems with them. The penalties are low and the targets \\noften insufficient.\u201d\\nLast year, Barclays helped raise $3bn worth of \\nsustainability-linked loans and bonds for Enbridge, a company that is \\ndramatically expanding oil and gas infrastructure across North America.\\nEnbridge is behind the construction of a controversial \\n1,000-mile pipeline that cuts through Indigenous land in the US to pump \\ntar sands oil. It paid US police to crack down on protesters and has \\nbeen fined millions of dollars for repeated environmental violations.\\n\u2018We do not need greener pipelines, we need to stop the reckless expansion of the fossil fuel industry\u2019\\nBarclays classifies the Enbridge debt as sustainable \\nbecause the company has set a target to cut emissions from its own \\noperations. In part, it intends to do this by using solar power to pump \\noil through its pipelines.\\n\u201cThe real source of emissions from a company like Enbridge \\nwill be from the oil and gas its pipelines help transport,\u201d said Jeanne \\nMartin from responsible investment charity ShareAction. \u201cWe do not need \\ngreener pipelines, we need to stop the reckless expansion of the fossil \\nfuel industry.\\n\u201cIf the conditions that a bank sets to provide financing to\\n oil and gas transport companies don\u2019t tackle oil and gas, the bank will\\n be accused of greenwashing.\u201d\\nBarclays also helped raise a $2.8bn sustainability-linked \\nloan for Harbour Energy, the UK\u2019s largest oil and gas producer. Harbour \\nextracted the equivalent of nearly 70m barrels of oil last year, which \\nif burned would produce the equivalent of eight coal-fired power \\nstations\u2019 annual emissions.\\nScientists agree that developing any new oil and gas fields\\n will derail climate targets and push global heating beyond 1.5 degrees \u2013\\n which the UN says will threaten lives, food sources and economies \\nworldwide.\\nIt seems that Harbour is aggressively exploring for new oil\\n and gas as it hopes to extract a further 880 million barrels of \\n"
