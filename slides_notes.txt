Slide 2: The Challenge: Information Overload for RDs

Title: The RD's Dilemma: Buried in Research, Missing Opportunities
Key Points:
Relationship Directors (RDs) spend significant time on manual research:
Sifting through internal systems (CRM, Core Banking, Loan Systems).
Scouring external sources (Companies House, news, annual reports, market data).
This manual effort is:
Time-consuming and inefficient.
Prone to inconsistencies.
Can lead to missed client opportunities (e.g., timely lending needs).
Goal: Free up RDs to focus on client relationships and strategic advice.
Speaker Notes: "Currently, our RDs are incredibly valuable, but a large portion of their time is dedicated to information gathering. This process, while necessary, is often manual and repetitive. We believe we can automate much of this, allowing them to leverage their expertise more effectively."
Slide 3: Our Solution: The "Opportunity Scout" Crew

Title: Introducing the "Opportunity Scout" - An Intelligent Agent Crew
Key Points:
A multi-agent system built using the CrewAI framework.
Automates the discovery and initial validation of client opportunities (e.g., lending, refinancing, FX needs).
Leverages specialized AI agents, each with unique roles, goals, and tools.
Provides RDs with synthesized, actionable intelligence and pre-populated application drafts.
(Diagram: A high-level visual showing "Client Data" -> "Opportunity Scout Crew" -> "Actionable Insights for RD")
Speaker Notes: "Our solution is an intelligent multi-agent system we're calling the 'Opportunity Scout.' It uses CrewAI to orchestrate a team of specialized AI agents that work together to find and qualify client opportunities, presenting the RD with a clear, concise summary and even a head start on documentation."
Slide 4: Why CrewAI? The Power of Collaborative AI

Title: Leveraging CrewAI for Sophisticated Automation
Key Points:
Collaborative Intelligence: CrewAI enables agents with distinct expertise to work together towards a common goal.
Role-Based Agents: Define agents with specific roles, goals, and backstories for focused task execution.
Customizable Tools: Easily integrate custom tools (Python functions) for agents to interact with internal APIs, external data sources, and perform specific analyses.
Flexible Task Management: Define tasks with clear descriptions and expected outputs, assigned to specific agents.
Orchestrated Processes: Supports different collaboration models (e.g., Process.sequential, Process.hierarchical).
Python Native: Seamless integration with our existing Python ecosystem and data science capabilities.
Speaker Notes: "We chose CrewAI because it allows us to build a sophisticated system where AI agents, much like a human team, can collaborate. Each agent has a defined role and access to specific tools – like an internal systems expert or an external market researcher. CrewAI orchestrates their work efficiently."
Slide 5: Core Components of Our CrewAI Implementation

Title: Building Blocks: Agents, Tasks, Tools & The Crew
Key Points (Illustrate with simple icons for each):
Agents:
Defined with role, goal, backstory, tools, llm.
Example: "Internal Data Specialist," "External Market Analyst."
Tools:
Python functions allowing agents to perform actions.
Examples: query_crm_tool, fetch_companies_house_data_tool, search_news_api_tool, analyze_financial_statement_tool.
Tasks:
Specific assignments for agents with description and expected_output.
Example: "Retrieve client's transaction history and existing facilities."
Crew:
The collection of agents and tasks.
Manages the execution process (e.g., sequential).
Speaker Notes: "In CrewAI, we define our individual 'workers' – the Agents – giving them roles, goals, and the specific tools they need. We then create Tasks, which are the jobs we need done, and assign them to agents. Finally, the Crew brings these agents and tasks together and manages how they work, for instance, in a sequential process."
Slide 6: Meet the "Opportunity Scout" Agents (Example for Lending)

Title: The Specialist Agents in Our Lending Opportunity Crew
Key Points (Can be one slide or split into multiple):
Client Profiler Agent (InternalSystemsAgent)
Role: Internal Data Specialist
Goal: To gather all relevant client information from internal bank systems.
Backstory: An expert navigator of the bank's CRM, core banking, and lending platforms.
Tools: crm_query_tool, account_balance_tool, existing_loan_tool.
LLM: (e.g., GPT-4, Claude 3 Sonnet - tuned for data extraction)
Market Intelligence Agent (ExternalResearchAgent)
Role: External Data & News Analyst
Goal: To find publicly available information about the client and their market.
Backstory: A digital detective skilled in web scraping, API querying, and news sentiment analysis.
Tools: companies_house_api_tool, web_search_tool (e.g., Google Search API, Tavily), news_api_tool, annual_report_finder_tool.
LLM: (e.g., GPT-4, Claude 3 Haiku - tuned for web research and summarization)
Financial Analyst Agent (FinancialAnalysisAgent)
Role: Financial Data Interpreter
Goal: To analyze financial statements and identify key financial health indicators.
Backstory: A meticulous analyst capable of extracting insights from balance sheets, P&L statements, and cash flow data.
Tools: financial_statement_parser_tool, ratio_calculator_tool, financial_summary_tool.
LLM: (e.g., GPT-4, Claude 3 Sonnet - tuned for financial analysis)
Opportunity Synthesizer Agent (ReportingAgent)
Role: Chief Reporting Officer
Goal: To consolidate all gathered information, identify potential opportunities, and generate a concise report and draft application.
Backstory: An expert communicator who transforms raw data from multiple sources into actionable insights for the RD.
Tools: report_generation_tool, pdf_filler_tool (using data to populate templates), risk_flagging_tool (basic).
LLM: (e.g., GPT-4, Claude 3 Opus - tuned for synthesis and report writing)
Speaker Notes: "For a lending opportunity, our crew consists of several specialist agents. The Client Profiler digs into our internal systems. The Market Intelligence Agent scans the external environment. The Financial Analyst crunches numbers from reports. And finally, the Opportunity Synthesizer brings it all together for the RD."
Slide 7: The Process: How the Crew Collaborates (Lending Example)

Title: Workflow: From Client ID to Actionable Insight
(Diagram: A simple flowchart showing the sequential process)
Input: Client ID / Name
Task 1 (Client Profiler Agent): Retrieve internal client data (history, existing facilities, CRM notes).
Output: Internal Client Profile
Task 2 (Market Intelligence Agent): Fetch external data (Companies House, news, annual report if found).
Context from Task 1 used.
Output: External Client & Market Profile
Task 3 (Financial Analyst Agent): Analyze financial data from internal/external sources (if available).
Context from Task 1 & 2 used.
Output: Financial Health Summary
Task 4 (Opportunity Synthesizer Agent): Consolidate all findings, identify lending opportunity rationale, generate summary report, and pre-fill draft loan application.
Context from Task 1, 2, & 3 used.
Output: Opportunity Report & Draft Application PDF/CSV
Output: RD receives synthesized information and draft documents.
Process Type: Process.sequential (for this initial version)
Speaker Notes: "The agents work in a coordinated sequence. The Client Profiler starts, its findings are passed to the Market Intelligence agent, and so on. Each agent builds upon the work of the previous one, culminating in a comprehensive package from the Synthesizer agent. We're using CrewAI's sequential process for this."
Slide 8: Technical Architecture Overview
